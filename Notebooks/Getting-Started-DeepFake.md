# Getting Started with Deepfake

Creating a deepfake involves several steps, including extracting frames from a video, detecting and aligning faces, training a deepfake model, generating deepfake frames, and finally combining these frames back into a video. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the process, with references to the provided code snippets.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Step 1: Download the Video

First, you need to download the video from YouTube using `pytubefix`.

```python
from pytubefix import YouTube
from pytubefix.cli import on_progress

url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLO5FZzfrS0"
yt = YouTube(url, on_progress_callback=on_progress)
print(yt.title)
ys = yt.streams.get_highest_resolution()
ys.download(output_path="videos")
```

This code downloads the video and saves it in the videos folder.

### Step 2: Extract Frames from the Video
Next, you extract frames from the downloaded video using OpenCV.

```python
import cv2
import os

def extract_frames(video_path, output_folder):
    try:
        if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
            os.makedirs(output_folder)
        
        cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
        if not cap.isOpened():
            print(f"Error: Could not open video file {video_path}")
            return
        
        count = 0
        while cap.isOpened():
            ret, frame = cap.read()
            if not ret:
                break
            cv2.imwrite(f"{output_folder}/frame{count:04d}.jpg", frame)
            count += 1
        cap.release()
        print(f"Extracted {count} frames from {video_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while extracting frames: {e}")

# Example usage
video_path = "videos/GLO5FZzfrS0.mp4"  # Adjust the filename as needed
extract_frames(video_path, "videos/frames")
```
This code extracts frames from the video and saves them in the videos/frames folder.

### Step 3: Detect
Faces in the Frames
Use the face_recognition library to detect faces in the extracted frames.

```python
import face_recognition

def detect_faces(image_path):
    image = face_recognition.load_image_file(image_path)
    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)
    return face_locations

# Example usage
frame_path = "videos/frames/frame0000.jpg"  # Adjust the filename as needed
face_locations = detect_faces(frame_path)
print(face_locations)
```

This code detects faces in a specific frame and returns their locations.

### Step 4: Align Faces
Align the detected faces to a standard format. This step is crucial for training the deepfake model. You can use libraries like dlib for face alignment.

```python 
import dlib

def align_face(image, face_location):
    predictor = dlib.shape_predictor("shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat")
    rect = dlib.rectangle(*face_location)
    shape = predictor(image, rect)
    face_chip = dlib.get_face_chip(image, shape)
    return face_chip

# Example usage
image = face_recognition.load_image_file(frame_path)
aligned_face = align_face(image, face_locations[0])
cv2.imwrite("aligned_face.jpg", aligned_face)python
```

### Step 5: Train a Deepfake Model
Use a deepfake model like DeepFaceLab or Faceswap to train on the aligned faces. This step involves a lot of computational resources and time.

```python 
# This is a placeholder for the training process
# You would typically use a tool like DeepFaceLab or Faceswap
# to train a model on the aligned faces
```

### Step 6: Generate Deepfake Frames

```python 
# This is a placeholder for generating deepfake frames
# You would use the trained model to generate new frames
# with the deepfake applied
```

### Step 7: Combine Frames into a Video

Finally, combine the generated deepfake frames back into a video using OpenCV.
```python 
def create_video(frame_folder, output_video):
    images = sorted([img for img in os.listdir(frame_folder) if img.endswith(".jpg")])
    frame = cv2.imread(os.path.join(frame_folder, images[0]))
    height, width, layers = frame.shape

    video = cv2.VideoWriter(output_video, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'DIVX'), 30, (width, height))

    for image in images:
        video.write(cv2.imread(os.path.join(frame_folder, image)))

    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    video.release()

# Example usage
create_video("deepfake_frames", "deepfake_video.avi")
```

This code combines the frames in the deepfake_frames folder into a video.
